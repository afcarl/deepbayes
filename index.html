                            At Deep|Bayes summer school, we will discuss how Bayesian Methods can be combined with Deep Learning and lead to better results in machine learning applications. Recent research has proven that the use of Bayesian approach can be beneficial in various ways. School participants will learn methods and techniques that are crucial for understanding current research in machine learning. They will also have an opportunity to draw connections between Bayesian Methods and Reinforcements Learning, learn modern stochastic optimization methods and regularization techniques for neural networks. Lectures will be followed by practical sessions.

                                <p>No, candidates will have to complete the application form. The participants will be selected on a competitive basis. Only approved candidates will be asked to proceed with paying the fee. The selection process is necessary because we have a limited number of spots available, and we also want to make sure that our participants have a suitable background to understand the material and have a useful experience at Deep|Bayes School.</p>
